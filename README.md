challenges coded in python

Dear surfer, please say "Hi", if you read these lines. :)

**Challenge#1** : Fireworks animation using Tkinter in Python. More explanation is inside the file, fireworks.py. Took a few hours to code, because this was my first attempt to generate multiple classes, and is one of my first codes in Python. (fireworks.py)

**Challenge#2** : RandomFlow animation using Tkinter in Python. More explanation is inside the script file (RandomFlow.py). 

**Challenge#3** : SmartRockets, animation and genetic algorithms. animation part is complete. Genetic Algorithm is not there, maybe later.

**Challenge#4** : CircleGrow: a photo, and tons of circles that grow to collage that photo. Quite slow, but works.

**Challenge#5** : Earthquake visualiser (for Turkey), More explanation is inside the file, EarthQuaker.py. Dirty code, but it works! It also contains remnants of a silly transformation checker (which I coded to learn about the Python language).

**Networking** : You can find a simple UDP sender and receiver set.
