challenges coded in python

Say "Hi", if you read these lines..

Challenge#1 : Fireworks animation using Tkinter in Python. More explanation is inside the file, fireworks.py. Took a few hours to code, because this was my first attempt to generate multiple classes, and is one of my first codes in Python. (fireworks.py)

Challenge#2 : RandomFlow animation using Tkinter in Python. More explanation is inside the script file (RandomFlow.py). 

Challenge#3 : SmartRockets, animation and genetic algorithms. animation part is complete. Genetic Algorithm is not done yet.

Challenge#4 : CircleGrow: a photo, and tons of circles that grow to collage that photo. Quite slow, but works.

Challenge#5 : Earthquake visualiser (for Turkey), More explanation is inside the file, EarthQuaker.py. Dirty code, but works. It contains remnants of a silly transformation checker (which I coded to learn about the Python language).
